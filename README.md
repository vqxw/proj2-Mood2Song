## Welcome to our Music Finder!

Our purpose is to help the user find new music or even reminisce some of 
the songs you used to listen to as a chlid. We created this program to help you
find new music in 3 different ways

** Note: I only uploaded my part of the project, so there will only be 1/3 ways **

## Finding Music by Mood

We give the user a list of moods, and then return some songs that we felt go best with their choice.
We did this by creating a dictionary per mood that holds a list of songs and
the artist(s) that follows. Because of how we formatted this, it is easily accessible for us to
continuously update the list and add songs or even moods without a hassle.
